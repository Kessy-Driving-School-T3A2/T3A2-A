<details>
    <summary>Click here to expand</summary>

#### Possible challanges

During the actual implimentation of this planning, we might need to change certain plans which will depend on

- Regular feedback checking regarding the balance between our **Client's need** and **possible outcome** of certain feature plans

- As a Developer team, we will try our best to create the features as promised and deliver it to the customer, still there is a possiblity of having an issue regarding time managemant and implimenting **Client's need** as this project is a **part of our Academic Assessment** and the **time limit** to finish the project is **controlled** by the Academy.

#### Possible solution

- Providing the details information about any featurs implimentaton. **how client want's it to be done** vs **how it will look after being done**, and change the plan if required

- Weekly meeting with our **Client** for through discussion about **what our Client needs** and **what can be done** in the **provided time period**
